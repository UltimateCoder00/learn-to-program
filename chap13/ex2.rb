# Orange tree. Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method
# that returns its height and a one_year_passes method that, when
# called, ages the tree one year. Each year the tree grows taller (however
# much you think an orange tree should grow in a year), and
# after some number of years (again, your call) the tree should die.
# For the first few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while
# it should, and I guess that older trees produce more each year
# than younger trees...whatever you think makes the most sense.
# And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which
# returns the number of oranges on the tree) and pick_an_orange
# (which reduces the @orange_count by 1 and returns a string telling
# you how delicious the orange was, or else it just tells you that there
# are no more oranges to pick this year). Make sure any oranges you
# donâ€™t pick one year fall off before the next year.
